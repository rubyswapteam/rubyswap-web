    title: 'We made "TheVerge"... Probably Nothing',
    message: `<p><em>Yuga Labs, the owner of three of the biggest NFT brands on the market, has raised $450 million in funding at a $4 billion valuation, the company announced today. The team behind Bored Ape Yacht Club plans to use the money to build a media empire around NFTs, starting with games and its own metaverse project.</em></p>
    <p><br /><em>The team describes its metaverse project, called Otherside, as an MMORPG meant to connect the broader NFT universe. They hope to create &ldquo;an interoperable world&rdquo; that is &ldquo;gamified&rdquo; and &ldquo;completely decentralized,&rdquo; says Wylie Aronow, a co-founder of Bored Ape Yacht Club who goes by the pseudonym Gordon Goner. &ldquo;We think the real Ready Player One experience will be player run.&rdquo;</em><br /><br /><em>The announcement comes just weeks after Yuga Labs made a major move to consolidate the NFT space, acquiring CryptoPunks and Meebits from Larva Labs. The acquisition put three of the most lucrative NFT collections under one roof &mdash; and gave Yuga Labs a bigger roster of IP to pull from when crafting its game and metaverse plans. The company also launched a cryptocurrency, ApeCoin, last week; the token will be governed independently and used as the primary currency in Yuga Labs&rsquo; properties.</em><br /><br /><em>Yuga Labs is partnering with &ldquo;a few different game studios&rdquo; to bring Otherside to life, says CEO Nicole Muniz. The game won&rsquo;t be limited to Bored Ape holders, and the company plans to create development tools that allow NFTs from other projects to work inside their world. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re opening the door to effectively a walled garden and saying &lsquo;Everybody&rsquo;s welcome.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>`,
